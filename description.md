# Intro to Approvals - Learning Hour Description

You can find an implementation of this learning hour [here](frames/index.md).

### Inbox

-   workflow diagram
-   building a new module vs testing existing code

## Goals

Participants will

-   be familiar with Approval Tests
-   experience the contrast with micro-assertions
-   ?? know how to use Approvals in their own work

In this Learning Hour, we focus on building simple code from scratch only.

## Agenda

-   Connect - 5m
-   Concept - 10m
-   Concrete - 30m (12m + 18m)
-   Conclusion - 5m

## Connect

Ask -

> How do you usually structure tests?
>
> How is a single test structured?
>
> How are multiple tests for a single module?

## Concept - Approval Tests Intro Explanation

## Concept - Demo

Demo: build the same code twice

1. The first time - with micro asserts
2. The second time - using approvals

## Concrete - Build with Micro-Asserts

Prepare a starting position of a kata to build simple code with a unit testing framework.
(I chose [FizzBuzz](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/fizzbuzz.html))
Provide clear, step-by-step instructions - a checklist.
If learners are familiar with ensemble work, have then rotate after each completed step.

Example snippet of such a checklist:

> -   [ ] `fizzbuzz(3)` (Fizz)
>
>     -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
>     -   [ ] see it fail
>     -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
>     -   [ ] refactor if you like
>
> -   [ ] `fizzbuzz(4)` (just another number)
>
>     -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
>     -   [ ] **challenge / optional:** see it fail
>     -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
>     -   [ ] refactor if you like

## Conclusion

Ask -

> "how did that feel?"

And gather people's thoughts.
