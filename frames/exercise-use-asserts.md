# Exercise - Use Asserts

Let's build [fizzbuzz](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/fizzbuzz.html) with micro-asserts.

-   [ ] run the assert-based test, see it fail
        in the terminal:

        ```
        cd typescript
        ./menu.sh
        ```

-   [ ] make the test pass, make only the smallest change necessary
        you can follow links with `ctrl + enter`
        [test is here](../typescript/fizzbuzz.spec.ts)
        [code is here](../typescript/fizzbuzz.ts)

-   [ ] run the assert-based test continuously in the terminal

    -   [ ] you can find the relevant script with `./menu.sh`
    -   [ ] test should still pass

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(2)`

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(3)`

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(4)`

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] **challenge / optional:** see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(5)`

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(6)`

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like
